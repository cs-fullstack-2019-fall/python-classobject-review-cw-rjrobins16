# Python classes review graded

### Problem 1:
Create a Movie class with the following properties/attributes: ```movieName```, ```rating```, and ```yearReleased```. 
* Override the default ```str``` (to-String) method and implement the code that will print the value of all the properties/attributes of the Movie class

* In your ```main``` function create *two* instances of the Product class
* Assign a value of your choosing for each property/attribute
* Print all properties to the console.

Remember, this is the basic model of a Python file with a class
```
class Movie:
	def __init__(self):
	# Class constructor code and property handling

	OTHER PROPERTIES AND METHODS HERE

def main():
	# Create class instance(s) and perform other activities in/from this function
}

main()
```

### Problem 2:
Create a class Product that represents a product sold online. 

A Product has ```price```, ```quantity``` and ```name``` properties/attributes. 
* Override the default ```str``` (to-String) method and implement the code that will print the value of all the properties/attributes of the Product class

* In your ```main``` function create *two* instances of the Product class
* Assign a value of your choosing for each property/attribute
* Print all properties to the console.
